It will probably become home to my more technical projects, so while I will do my best to articulate what I'm talking about, do note there may be some prerequisite knowledge for some things, or I may spew nonsense (I'll try to avoid the latter). <br> If you are interested in a more regularly-updated and shorter form of my case studies, I make an effort to regularly post my adventures on Threads. Topics that I see as especially interesting will make their way here."
