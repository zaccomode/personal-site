# 2023 personal site
After literally a year of procrastination, I rebuilt and replaced my [old website](https://github.com/zaccomode/website-old) in React. It's significantly more lightweight than its predecessor, but that's mainly because I've moved away from blogging and other things. If you want to see my work, it's easy enough to click the Instagram, etc. buttons, right?

This is also the first site that I've made using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Prior to this, everything I've made with React has run on Create React App, but since that was depreciated recently I figured it was time to move on.
